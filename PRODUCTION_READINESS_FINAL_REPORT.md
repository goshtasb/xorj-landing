## 🔄 Journey from Wind Tunnel to Monaco Grand Prix

### **Phase 1: Wind Tunnel Testing (Insufficient)**
- ✅ Algorithm logic validated in perfect conditions
- ❌ **CRITICAL GAP**: No real-world resilience testing
- ❌ **False confidence**: 2.3-second execution in sterile environment

### **Phase 2: Algorithm Safety-First Tuning**
- ✅ Corrected weights to enforce safety-first principle
- ✅ **New weights**: Sharpe 40%, ROI 15%, Drawdown 45%
- ✅ **Correct ranking**: Pro → Safe Bet → Gambler

### **Phase 3: Monaco Grand Prix Chaos Testing**
- ✅ **Network failures**: RPC timeouts and API failures
- ✅ **Database failures**: Connection drops during execution
- ✅ **On-chain failures**: Slippage and transaction failures
- ✅ **Recovery validation**: System resilience proven
