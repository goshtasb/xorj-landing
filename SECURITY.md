# XORJ Platform Security Guide

## 🔐 Credential Management

### Critical Security Rules

1. **NEVER commit credentials to version control**
2. **Use strong, unique credentials for each environment** 
3. **Rotate credentials regularly**
4. **Store credentials securely** (password manager, secure vault)

### Fixed Security Issues

✅ **Removed hardcoded credentials** from all environment files  
✅ **Implemented credential validation** with strength requirements  
✅ **Added secure environment initialization** with validation  
✅ **Fixed authentication bypass** - signature verification now required in all environments  
✅ **Enhanced JWT security** with algorithm specification and error sanitization  

## 🛠️ Setting Up Secure Credentials

### 1. Generate Secure Credentials

Use the provided script to generate cryptographically secure credentials:

```bash
# Generate credentials for development
node scripts/generate-credentials.js generate development

# Generate credentials for production
node scripts/generate-credentials.js generate production

# Validate existing credentials
node scripts/generate-credentials.js validate .env.local
```

### 2. Manual Credential Generation

For JWT secrets and other credentials:

```bash
# Generate 64-character JWT secret
openssl rand -hex 64

# Generate 32-character database password
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate random string
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
```

### 3. Environment File Setup

1. Copy the template: `cp .env.template .env.local`
2. Replace placeholder values with secure credentials
3. Verify file permissions: `chmod 600 .env.local`

## 🔍 Credential Requirements

### JWT Secrets
- **Minimum length**: 64 characters
- **Must contain**: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters  
- **Must not contain**: common words, predictable patterns

### Database Passwords
- **Minimum length**: 32 characters
- **Must be unique** per environment
- **Avoid**: common passwords, dictionary words

### Environment Validation

The platform automatically validates:
- ✅ Required environment variables present
- ✅ Credential strength requirements
- ✅ Production environment security checks
- ✅ JWT algorithm specification

## 🚨 Security Monitoring

### Startup Validation

Environment validation runs automatically at startup:

```typescript
import { validateEnvironmentOnStartup } from '@/lib/validation/middleware';

// Call during application initialization
const validation = validateEnvironmentOnStartup();
if (!validation.success) {
  console.error('Environment validation failed:', validation.errors);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Runtime Security

- JWT tokens validated with algorithm specification
- Error messages sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities fixed
- Rate limiting enforced on authentication endpoints

## 🔧 Development vs Production

### Development Environment
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Use testnet/devnet blockchain networks
- Lower security requirements for testing
- **Still requires signature verification** (no bypassing)

### Production Environment
- **Strong credential validation** enforced
- **HTTPS required** for all endpoints
- **Database SSL** connections required
- **No development patterns** in credentials
- **Mainnet blockchain** networks only

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All credentials generated securely
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] Environment validation passes
- [ ] JWT secrets are 64+ characters  
- [ ] Database passwords are 32+ characters
- [ ] SSL/TLS enabled for database connections
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for web endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Error logging sanitized
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities resolved

## 🆘 Incident Response

If credentials are compromised:

1. **Immediately rotate** all affected credentials
2. **Revoke** all existing JWT tokens
3. **Update** environment variables
4. **Restart** all services
5. **Monitor** for suspicious activity
6. **Audit** access logs

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries (already implemented)
- Enable SSL connections in production
- Implement connection pooling limits
- Regular backup and encryption

### API Security  
- Rate limiting on all endpoints (implemented)
- CORS with strict origin validation (implemented)
- Content Security Policy headers (implemented)
- Input validation with Zod schemas (implemented)

### Monitoring & Logging
- Sanitized error logging (implemented)
- Request/response logging
- Security event monitoring
- Failed authentication tracking
