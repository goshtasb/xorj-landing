## 🚨 Issues Identified & Resolutions

### Issue #1: Undefined Variable Reference ✅ FIXED
```typescript
// BEFORE: SimpleWalletContext.tsx:116,123,161,163
if (isConnecting) { // ❌ undefined variable
  setIsConnecting(true); // ❌ undefined function

// AFTER: Fixed in commit 
if (connecting) { // ✅ using existing state
  setConnecting(true); // ✅ using existing setter
```

### Issue #2: Test Framework Not Automated ⚠️ PENDING
```bash
Problem: Tests exist but no npm test script configured
Solution: Add testing framework (Jest/Vitest) to package.json
Priority: Medium (tests are comprehensive, just need automation)
```

### Issue #3: Minor Warning - User ID Handling ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE
```bash
Warning: "No user ID returned from gateway - skipping database update"
Impact: Non-critical, fallback behavior working correctly
Status: Expected behavior when user not in gateway database
```
