   - *Mitigation: Start with small amounts, gradual rollout*

3. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Could compromise users
   - *Mitigation: Professional security audit required*

### **Medium Risk Items**
1. **Performance Under Load** - App might slow down
   - *Mitigation: Load testing and infrastructure scaling*

2. **Database Issues** - Data loss or corruption
   - *Mitigation: Regular backups and transaction integrity*

3. **Regulatory Changes** - Legal landscape shifts
   - *Mitigation: Legal review and compliance monitoring*
